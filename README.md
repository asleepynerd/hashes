# hashes
A public repo with all of the hashing algorithms I've made.

## How to use.

I have made a collection of remakes of different hashes - crc64 (derived from crc32), md7 (derived from md5/6), sha1024 (derived from sha256), and my own creation, Ush (Unicode secure hash.)

### crc64

```
crc64  [-h
--help
-v
--version] [input data]
```
